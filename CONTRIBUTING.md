# Contributing to awesome-metric-learning
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug / typo
- Discussing the current state of the content
- Submitting a new item to be listed
- Proposing new content

## We Publish with Github
We use github to host content, to track issues and content requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Content Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the content (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Add content under the proper section.
3. Mark it with a `domain tag` such as `NLP` and/or `CV`, if applicable.
4. Make sure that it is well formatted and grammatically correct.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Choose the right section for your contribution
We organize listings in several sections for easy navigation. Decide on the right section according the following guidelines:

- **Surveys**: Detailed overviews of the field.
- **Applications**: Working codebases to solve a specific problem.
- **Case Studies**: Articles by well known companies and innovative startups detailing how they solve their problems.
- **Libraries**: Well-crafted codebases with re-usable and generic utilities to solve certain types of problems.
- **Tools**: Useful working applications that do not require interaction with the source code.
- **Approximate Nearest Neighbors**: Implementations of relevant algorithms.
- **Papers**: Seminal academic works that shape the field.
- **Datasets**: Useful benchmarking data sources.
