😎 Awesome list about practical Metric Learning and its applications

## Surveys 📖
- [What is Metric Learning?](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/metric-learn/introduction.html)
> A beginner-friendly starting point for traditional metric learning methods from scikit-learn website. It has proceeding guides for [supervised](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/metric-learn/supervised.html), [weakly supervised](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/metric-learn/weakly_supervised.html) and [unsupervised](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/metric-learn/unsupervised.html) metric learning algorithms in [`metric_learn`](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/metric-learn/metric_learn.html) package.
- [Deep Metric Learning: A Survey](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/11/9/1066/htm)
> A comprehensive study in which factors such as sampling strategies, distance metrics and network structures are systematically analyzed by comparing the quantitative results of the methods.
- [Deep Metric Learning: A (Long) Survey](https://hav4ik.github.io/articles/deep-metric-learning-survey)
> An intuitive survey of the need for metric learning, old and state-of-the-art approaches, and some real world use cases.
- [A Tutorial on Distance Metric Learning: Mathematical Foundations, Algorithms, Experimental Analysis, Prospects and Challenges (with Appendices on Mathematical Background and Detailed Algorithms Explanation)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05944)
> The long title itself is a good description of this great survey. It is intended for those interested in mathematical foundations of metric learning.


## Applications ⚒️
- [Detic](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detic)
> Code released for ["Detecting Twenty-thousand Classes using Image-level Supervision"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02605). It is an open-class object detector to detect any label encoded by CLIP without finetuning. See [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/akhaliq/Detic).


## Libraries 🧰
- [sentence-transformers](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers)
> Developed on top of the well known [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library, it provides an easy way to finetune Transformer-based models to obtain sequence-level embeddings.
- [pytorch-metric-learning](https://github.com/KevinMusgrave/pytorch-metric-learning)
> Modular, flexible and extensible library implementing losses, miners, samplers and trainers for metric learning in PyTorch.
- [tensorflow-similarity](https://github.com/tensorflow/similarity)
> A library in the TensorFlow ecosystem with a Keras-like API, providing support for self-supervised contrastive learning and state-of-the-art methods such as SimCLR, SimSian and Barlo Twins.


## Papers 🔬
- [Learning Distance Metrics from Probabilistic Information](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~lusu/papers/TKDD2020.pdf)
> Working with datasets that contain probabilistic labels instead of deterministic values.


## Datasets ℹ️
> Any labelled or unlabelled data can be used for metric learning with an appropriate method chosen. However some datasets are particularly important in the literature for benchmarking or in some other way, and we list them in this section.
