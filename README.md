## Surveys ðŸ“–
- [What is Metric Learning?](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/metric-learn/introduction.html)
> A beginner-friendly starting point for traditional metric learning methods from scikit-learn website. It has proceeding guides for [supervised](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/metric-learn/supervised.html), [weakly supervised](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/metric-learn/weakly_supervised.html) and [unsupervised](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/metric-learn/unsupervised.html) metric learning algorithms in [`metric_learn`](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/metric-learn/metric_learn.html) package.
- [Deep Metric Learning: A Survey](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/11/9/1066/htm)
> A comprehensive study in which factors such as sampling strategies, distance metrics and network structures are systematically analyzed by comparing the quantitative results of the methods.
- [Deep Metric Learning: A (Long) Survey](https://hav4ik.github.io/articles/deep-metric-learning-survey)
> An intuitive survey of the need for metric learning, old and state-of-the-art approaches, and some real world use cases.
- [A Tutorial on Distance Metric Learning: Mathematical Foundations, Algorithms, Experimental Analysis, Prospects and Challenges (with Appendices on Mathematical Background and Detailed Algorithms Explanation)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05944)
> The long title itself is a good description of this great survey. It is intended for those interested in mathematical foundations of metric learning.
